    <p>This project would not have been possible without the financial support received from the HES-SO
(University of Applied Sciences, Western Switzerland), which the authors wish to sincerely thank.
Thanks are also due to the AR&D (Applied Research and Development) team of the Haute Ecole
Arc de Conservation-restauration (HE Arc CR) for their administrative and technical assistance, as
well as the conservators that were involved in the project: Aur√©lie von Bieberstein, who collected
the samples from the institutions mentioned below and developed the standardized recording
sheet, and Anouk Jaggi who made the drawings of the cross-sections and assisted in the collection
of the samples. Special thanks go to Valentin Boissonnas who revised the metallography and
corrosion studies, and also the contents of this report.</p>
